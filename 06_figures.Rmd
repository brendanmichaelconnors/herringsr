Lines show 5-year running means for age-2 to age-10 herring (incrementing higher from the lowest line); the thick black line highlights age-3 herring. Missing weight-at-age values (i.e., years where there are no biological samples) are imputed using one of two methods: missing values at the beginning of the time series are imputed by extending the frst non-missing value backwards; other missing values are imputed as the mean of the previous 5 years. Biological summaries only include samples collected using seine nets (commercial and test) due to size-selectivity of other gear types such as gillnet.
