# Analysis and response

## Input data

Input data to the stock assessment are summarized in \@ref(tab:data-input).
Relative to last year's assessment, the only change made to input data was updating the time series to include data from the `r this_season` herring season (July 1 to June 30).

## Catch data

For the purposes of stock assessment, catch data are summarized by gear type and fishing category as described in Table \@ref(tab:data-input) and presented in Figure \@ref(fig:major-catch).

As per previous years, catch input to the stock assessment model does not include mortality from the commercial SOK fshery, nor any recreational or food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) fisheries. The FSC and recreational catches are considered minor relative to commercial harvest. The commercial SOK fshery is licensed based on pounds of validated SOK product (i.e., eggs adhered to kelp), not tonnes of fsh used or spawned. Currently there is no basis for validating mortality imposed on the population by this fshery, however methods for estimating SOK mortality are being developed.

Combined commercial removals from 2010 to 2018 from the roe, food and bait, and special use fisheries are presented for the major stocks in Table \@ref(tab:annual-catch). The proportion of coast-wide catch that comes from the SoG was 22\\% in 1990, and has increased to greater than 95\\% in `r assess_yr`. Total SOK harvest is presented for the major SARs in Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch).

## Biological data

Biological samples are collected as described in @cleary2018 and Table \@ref(tab:data-input). The biological data inputs to the stock assessment are annual weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-wa)) and annual numbers-at-age, shown as proportions-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-pa)).

Signifcant declines in weight-at-age are evident for all major herring stocks, from the mid-1980s to 2010. Declining weight-at-age may be attributed to any number of factors, including fishing effects (i.e., gear selectivity) and environmental effects (e.g., changes in ocean productivity), or it may be attributed to changes in sampling protocols (e.g., shorter time frame over which samples are collected). An increasing trend in weight-at-age is now apparent for all major stocks from 2012 to 2018, although to a lesser degree for PRD.

## Abundance data

The surface (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`) and dive (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`) spawn survey methods involve collecting information on spawn length (parallel to shore), spawn width (perpendicular to shore), and number of egg layers by vegetation type. These data are used to calculate egg densities per spawn. Ultimately, the estimated weight of mature spawners required to produce the egg deposition is calculated and referred to as the spawn index. Execution of the `r surv_yr_rng[2]` spawn survey followed all standard protocols as described in @cleary2018. Time series of spawn index by major stock area, from `r paste(surv_yr_rng, collapse=" to ")` are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index). In `r surv_yr_rng[2]`, there was an increase in survey biomass in SoG and WCVI (Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index) and Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-sog) and \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi)) and a decrease in survey biomass in PRD and CC (Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index) and Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-prd) and \@ref(tab:spawn-index-cc)). HG survey biomass has remained at historical low levels since 2016 (Table \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg)).

## Spatial spawn distribution

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg)-\@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) summarize the spatial distribution of survey spawn biomass (i.e., the spawn index) and proportions over years for the major SARs. We summarise HG, PRD, CC, and WCVI by Statistical Area, and SoG by Group, where choice of spatial grouping refects spawning behaviour and biology for each SAR based on the survey data and working group discussions with local First Nations. Sections and Groups are not intended to represent sub-stock structure or ‘known’ stocklets.

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg)-\@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) also present annual proportions of survey spawn index expressed as biomass by Statistical Area or Group for the last fve years, and average proportions by Statistical Area or Group for 1 to 5 years. To facilitate comparisons, these tables also include spawn index by year.
