# Analysis and response

## Input data

Input data to the stock assessment are summarized in \@ref(tab:data-input).
Relative to last year's assessment, the only change made to input data was updating the time series to include data from the `r this_season` herring season (July 1 to June 30).

## Catch data

For the purposes of stock assessment, catch data are summarized by gear type and fishing category as described in Table \@ref(tab:data-input) and presented in Figure \@ref(fig:major-catch).

As per previous years, catch input to the stock assessment model does not include mortality from the commercial SOK fishery, nor any recreational or food, social, and ceremonial (FSC) fisheries. The FSC and recreational catches are considered minor relative to commercial harvest. The commercial SOK fishery is licensed based on pounds of validated SOK product (i.e., eggs adhered to kelp), not tonnes of fish used or spawned. Currently there is no basis for validating mortality imposed on the population by this fishery, however methods for estimating SOK mortality are being developed.

Combined commercial removals from 2010 to 2018 from the roe, food and bait, and special use fisheries are presented for the major stocks in Table \@ref(tab:annual-catch). The proportion of coast-wide catch that comes from the SoG was 22\\% in 1990, and has increased to greater than 95\\% in `r assess_yr`. Total SOK harvest is presented for the major SARs in Table \@ref(tab:annual-sok-catch).

## Biological data

Biological samples are collected as described in @cleary2018 and Table \@ref(tab:data-input). The biological data inputs to the stock assessment are annual weight-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-wa)) and annual numbers-at-age, shown as proportions-at-age (Figure \@ref(fig:major-pa)).

Signifcant declines in weight-at-age are evident for all major herring stocks, from the mid-1980s to 2010. Declining weight-at-age may be attributed to any number of factors, including fishing effects (i.e., gear selectivity) and environmental effects (e.g., changes in ocean productivity), or it may be attributed to changes in sampling protocols (e.g., shorter time frame over which samples are collected). An increasing trend in weight-at-age is now apparent for all major stocks from 2012 to 2018, although to a lesser degree for PRD.

## Abundance data

The surface (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`) and dive (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`) spawn survey methods involve collecting information on spawn length (parallel to shore), spawn width (perpendicular to shore), and number of egg layers by vegetation type. These data are used to calculate egg densities per spawn. Ultimately, the estimated weight of mature spawners required to produce the egg deposition is calculated and referred to as the spawn index. Execution of the `r surv_yr_rng[2]` spawn survey followed all standard protocols as described in @cleary2018. Time series of spawn index by major stock area, from `r paste(surv_yr_rng, collapse=" to ")` are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index). In `r surv_yr_rng[2]`, there was an increase in survey biomass in SoG and WCVI (Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index) and Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-sog) and \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi)) and a decrease in survey biomass in PRD and CC (Figure \@ref(fig:major-spawn-index) and Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-prd) and \@ref(tab:spawn-index-cc)). HG survey biomass has remained at historical low levels since 2016 (Table \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg)).

## Spatial spawn distribution

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg)-\ through \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) summarize the spatial distribution of survey spawn biomass (i.e., the spawn index) and proportions over years for the major SARs. We summarise HG, PRD, CC, and WCVI by Statistical Area, and SoG by Group, where choice of spatial grouping refects spawning behaviour and biology for each SAR based on the survey data and working group discussions with local First Nations. Sections and Groups are not intended to represent sub-stock structure or ‘known’ stocklets.

Tables \@ref(tab:spawn-index-hg) through \@ref(tab:spawn-index-wcvi) also present annual proportions of survey spawn index expressed as biomass by Statistical Area or Group for the last fve years, and average proportions by Statistical Area or Group for 1 to 5 years. To facilitate comparisons, these tables also include spawn index by year.

## First Nations observations

First Nations observations are provided by First Nations representatives to describe their perspective in their respective local areas.

### Hadia Gwaii

The `r assess_yr` herring spawn survey on Haida Gwaii was conducted from April 7 to 21 within Area 2 East. Haida traditional harvest of spawn on kelp observed in the major stock area was low.

### Prince Rupert District

This year in the Prince Rupert District, Lax Kw’alaams had several fishermen out on the water. One of the members was on the water for a full eight days. He and his crew observed lots of herring, at least 10,000 fish, swimming in the region for several days. After four to five days of observation, they disappeared. It should be noted that there were whales feeding on these fish over the observation period. It is possible that these fish felt there was too much predation and they moved to deeper water to spawn or they were eaten by the whales. Some spawning was observed, but it was not as much as expected based on the herring observed.

Lax Kw’alaams gill net fishermen reported that the use of nets with a smaller mesh size yielded better catches. The fish obtained were smaller than normal. Most of the gill net fishermen did not gather enough fish to satisfy FSC needs. For the SOK fishery in the Prince Rupert District, there was very little spawn obtained and with insuffcient amounts needed to satisfy the FSC needs of the community. Many of the ponds that were established (four) were destroyed by sea lions preying on captive fish.

Lax Kw’alaams Fisheries Technicians spent four days during the harvest monitoring and recording herring. They found no schools of fish on any of the days they were out. Their correspondence with harvesters on the water confrmed the absence of herring.

Similar observations were reported by members of the Metlakatla First Nation. Metlakatla members were unsuccessful again in `r assess_yr` in achieving their Section 35(1) needs for herring spawn-on-kelp or -on-branches. The last catch reports were submitted from community members during the early 2000s, and this information is refected in the catch reporting to the AFS Manager at that time. Although effort was made in `r assess_yr`, with assistance from DFO staff, to obtain SOK from the fishery, it was not successful due to many circumstances, including very low herring biomass. Metlakatla technicians participated in field work with Lax Kw’alaams during one of their patrols, and the lack of fish, spawn, and wildlife indicated to our technician that the stocks are seriously depressed.

### Central Coast

FSC fishermen and SOK fishermen from both the Heiltsuk and Kitasoo/Xai’xais Nations reported very challenging fishing seasons in 2018, resulting in less and overall lower-grade product than in previous years, due to a combination of low tonnage of spawners, high predator pressure, and unusual spawner behaviour.

Heiltsuk harvesters reported generally low spawner volume and a high incidence of spot spawning, exacerbated by seals and sea lions, which frequently disturbed spawning aggregations. The main spawn lasted only two days, which is shorter than usual. Although what appeared to be a strong spawning event occurred in Spiller Channel, spawning was too brief and/or deep to obtain any product. In general, harvesters found it more diffcult than usual to predict the erratic spawner behaviour. Some harvesters would get only one or two layers on their kelp, not enough for merchantable product, while others reported that it took much longer than usual to cover the kelp with a suffcient number of layers (a week instead of a few days).

Kitasoo harvesters also observed that the tonnage of fish available had noticeably dropped from previous years. Sea lions continue to be a major problem for fishing, especially in the SOK fishery. Higgins Pass had very small tonnage in the area prior to spawning. Overall these observations signal a reduction in biomass in `r assess_yr`. Spawn timing was similar to previous years, though it has been trending earlier over the past 8 to 10 years (18 days earlier than the 2010/2011 season). The fish held deeper than normal, and spawned very intensely over a shorter period than normal.

### Strait of Georgia

Hul’q’umi’num Nations report that little to no spawn activity occurred south of Dodd Narrows in `r assess_yr`. Additionally, there was limited predator activity observed, and a number of species/predators seemed to have moved from the area (predators were less numerous than previous years). FSC roe catch was gathered within the traditional fishing territory but outside of the immediate core territory. There was also an issue with cholera that required an extensive community outreach collaboration with the health department of Hul’q’umi’num, taking time that would have otherwise been spent continuing to look for spawn in the area.

### West Coast Vancouver Island

There were several observations from Nuu-chah-nulth harvesters and Fisheries Technicians regarding WCVI herring in `r assess_yr`. Very early spawn was observed in Hesquiaht Harbour, and on the west side of Barkley Sound (January). A January spawn in Hesquiaht Harbour is a common event, but not in Barkley. There were small spawning events in February, primarily in Area 24. The main spawning events in Areas 23 to 25 were in mid to late March. Due to the distinct timing and relatively small spawn, the early Hesquiaht and Barkley spawns were not assessed by divers or included in the WCVI assessment. Marine vegetation from the early spawn collected by Hesquiaht residents corresponded to one to two layers of eggs.

For the main WCVI herring spawning, Nuu-chah-nulth harvesters set whole trees and lines of tree branches to harvest herring spawn-on-bough (SOB). Trees and boughs were set in both usual herring spawning locations and in active spawning locations in Barkley Sound (Area 23), Clayoquot Sound (Area 24), Nootka Sound, Esperanza Inlet, Nuchatlitz (Area 25), and Kyuquot Sound (Area 26, which is outside of DFO assessment area for WCVI herring). Herring SOB harvests were mixed. In both Areas 23 and 24 some harvesters succeeded with one or two trees acquiring four to six layers, whereas some trees had only one to two layers (a minimum of four to six layers of eggs are necessary to provide enough eggs to peel off branches for harvesting). Harvests in Areas 23 and 24 were well below community food needs. In Area 25 both SOB and SOK harvest occurred in the northern and southern areas. Although signifcantly less than observed in the mid to late 1990’s, the SOK and SOB harvests in 2018 were the largest in over 10 years with many trees having over eight layers.

## Stock status update

Analyses of stock trend information for AM2 are presented following methods of @cleary2018 for the Pacifc Herring major stocks. Perceptions of stock status based on outputs from the SCA model (AM2) are summarized for each stock in a six-panel figure (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)). The six panels (a–f) include:

a. Time series of maximum posterior density (MPD) estimates of the spawn survey data in thousands of tonnes. The spawn survey data (i.e., spawn index) is scaled to abundance via the spawn survey scaling parameter $q$. The spawn index has two distinct periods defined by the dominant survey method: surface surveys (`r surv_yr_rng[1]` to `r new_surv_yr - 1`), and dive surveys (`r new_surv_yr` to `r surv_yr_rng[2]`). Two q parameters are implemented in the estimation procedure: $q_1$ with an uninformative prior and $q_2$ with an informative prior approximating 1.0.

b. Time series of natural mortality ($M$) estimates

c. Time series reconstruction of number of age-2 recruits

d. Time series of total catch and estimated spawning biomass with reference line at model estimates of $0.3SB_0$

e. Time series of (log) deviations from the estimated Beverton-Holt recruitment function overlaid with a 3-year trailing moving average smoother

f. Phase plot of spawning biomass production for the dive survey period (MPD estimates), with reference line at model estimates of $0.3SB_0$

## Reference points

A biological limit reference point (LRP) is defned for the major Pacific Herring SARs at $0.3SB_0$ [@kronlund2017]. Candidate upper stock references (USR) were introduced in @cleary2018 and implemented as biomass objectives in the simulation analyses for WCVI and SoG [dfo2018]. Candidate USRs are:

1. $0.4SB_0$,

2. $0.6SB_0$,

3. average spawning biomass from `r start_yr` to `r assess_yr`, $SB_{ave}$, and

4. average spawning biomass during a productive period [@cleary2018], $SB_{ave-prod}$.

Simulation results showed similar properties between USRs $0.6SB_0$ and $SB_{ave}$ both within and among SARs, while the USR based on the average biomass in a productive period, $SB_{ave-prod}$, was found to be most variable among SARs. The simulation-evaluations did not select a single USR, however a USR of $0.6SB_0$ is included in this stock status update because this candidate is suffciently above the LRP (2*LRP) and it is a repeatable calculation across all SARs. Stock status relative to the assessment model estimates $0.3SB_0$ (LRP) and $0.6SB_0$ (USR) are presented for each stock in Tables \@ref(tab:ref-points-hg) through \@ref(tab:ref-points-wcvi).

The LRP and the USR relate stock status to the DFO PA Framework [@dfo09] and in this assessment the same calculations are applied for each SAR. These reference points differ from operational control points (OCPs) which are the biomass levels where management action is taken (i.e., the infection points of the harvest control rule; HCR). OCPs and HCRs differ among SARs, and are described below.

### Haida Gwaii

Estimated spawning biomass declined to near historic lows in the mid-1990s and briefy increased through the late 1990s before falling to persistent historic lows from 2000 to 2010 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)d). A modest increase in estimated spawning biomass occurred during the early 2010s before falling once again to near historic lows over the most recent few years. The increase can be attributed to increases in the survey biomass index in 2012 and 2014 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)a) that were supported by above average recruitment of age-2 fish in 2012 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)c, d). An increasing trend in the estimated natural mortality rate since 1980 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)b) largely absorbed surplus production attributable to above average recruitment events (e.g., 1997 and 2012; Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)c, d). In particular, estimated natural mortality has increased sharply since the early 2010s following a decline from a peak rate in the early 2000s. In most years since 2000, including the most recent year between `r assess_yr - 1` and `r assess_yr` spawning periods, the HG stock has persistently existed in a low productivity, low biomass state which has precluded stock growth (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)f). Although an increasing trend in weight-at-age has been observed since 2012 (Figure \@ref(fig:major-wa)), this increase in biomass per individual has not been suffcient to offset the lack of increased numbers of herring, which implies there are larger but fewer herring individuals per tonne of spawners.

Estimated spawning biomass in `r assess_yr` is `r f(hg_final_yr_sbt[2])` t (`r paste0("$SB_{", assess_yr, "}$")`, median posterior value) or `r f(hg_final_yr_sbt[2]/hg_sbo[2] * 100, 1)`\% of $SB_0$ (Table \@ref(tab:ref-points-hg)). The `r assess_yr` spawning biomass is estimated to be at a historic low level, exceeded only by more severe depletion levels following the stock collapse of the 1960s (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-hg)d). Since 2000, the effective harvest rate, Ut, has been at or near zero (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)), with the last commercial roe fishery in 2002 and the last commercial SOK fishery in 2004. Spawning biomass in `r assess_yr` is estimated to be less than the LRP of $0.3SB_0$ with a `r f(hg_prob_less_03sbo[2] * 100, 1)`\% probability (Table \@ref(tab:ref-points-hg)).

### Prince Rupert District

Estimated spawning biomass recovered by the mid-1980s from historic low depletion levels following the collapse of the 1960s, to about 50\% of the historic high biomass estimated in the
early 1960s (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)d). However, after the mid-1980s estimated spawning biomass steadily declined before stabilizing at a relatively low level (but above historic lows) by the mid-2000s. The estimated stock biomass has shown little trend from 2005 to 2018. Fluctuations in the trend in spawning biomass appear to be less than those observed in other SARs, possibly because some spawn index points are being under- or over-ft (e.g., 2001–2004, 2010, 2013) as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)a. Estimated natural mortality reached historic highs in the late 1960s, before declining through the late 1970s. Beginning in about 1980, estimated natural mortality increased through to `r assess_yr`, roughly doubling from 0.25 to 0.5 yr-1 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)b). This trend in natural mortality coincides with the decline in spawning biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)d); recruitment deviations have fuctuated around 0 without any strong positive or negative trending (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)e). An above average age-2+ recruitment in 2014 and modest recruitment in 2016 were not suffcient to raise the stock from a low biomass state (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-prd)f). Despite relatively low and stable levels of catch it appears the estimated increase in natural mortality has absorbed the potential for positive higher surplus production. An increasing trend in weight-at-age has been observed since about 2010, although the change does not appear to be as large as in the HG, CC, SoG and WCVI SARs.

The model estimates spawning biomass in `r assess_yr`, `r paste0("$SB_{", assess_yr, "}$")`, at `r f(prd_final_yr_sbt[2])` t (posterior median), equal to `r f(prd_final_yr_sbt[2]/prd_sbo[2] * 100, 1)`\% of $SB_0$ (Table \@ref(tab:ref-points-prd)). Commercial fisheries have occurred annually in PRD since the mid-1980s during which the effective harvest rate, $U_t$, is estimated to be at or below 20\% (Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)), with the exception of 1989. Spawning biomass in `r assess_yr` is estimated to be less than the LRP of $0.3SB_0$ with a `r f(prd_prob_less_03sbo[2] * 100, 1)`\% probability (Table \@ref(tab:ref-points-prd)).

### Central Coast

Estimated spawning biomass fuctuated around a strongly declining trend from a historic high around 1980 before reaching a historic low level in the late 2000s (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)d). An increase in spawning stock biomass was estimated through the mid-2010s but remained below levels estimated prior to 2000, and then declining modestly through to `r assess_yr`. The estimated biomass trend largely refects the trend in the spawn index (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)a), where fluctuations correspond in opposite phase to the fluctuations in estimated natural mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)b). For example, the decline in spawn index (and estimated spawning biomass) to the historic lows of the late 2000s followed a strongly increasing trend in estimated natural mortality through the same period. Estimated natural mortality moderated by the late 2000s, which was followed by the increase in spawn index (and estimated spawning biomass) until 2015 whereupon natural mortality again increased. Recruitment deviations have been slightly negative (lower than predicted by the stock-recruit function) on average since about 1990 (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)e). Production has tended to be near zero or negative over recent years, although the stock does not appear to have lapsed back to the low production, low biomass state observed during the late 2000s/early 2010s (Figure \@ref(fig:storyboard-cc)f). However there is no evidence of strong production as observed, for example, during the 1990 to 1999 period.

Since implementing the current HCR in 1986, the effective harvest rate, $U_t$, is estimated to fluctuate above and below the 20\% target rate, with median estimates exceeding 20\% frequently Figure \@ref(fig:harvest-rate)). Occurrences of $U_t$ exceeding the 20\% target rate are due in part to positive assessment model errors.

Following a commercial fishery closure from 2007 to 2013, the CC stock reopened to commercial fisheries in 2014 and small commercial roe fisheries occurred in 2014, 2015, and 2016. A commercial SOK fishery has operated yearly since 2014, however these removals are not
included in the estimation of $U_t$.

The model estimates spawning biomass in `r assess_yr`, `r paste0("$SB_{", assess_yr, "}$")`, at `r f(cc_final_yr_sbt[2])` t (posterior median), equal to `r f(cc_final_yr_sbt[2]/cc_sbo[2] * 100, 1)`\% of $SB_0$ (Table \@ref(tab:ref-points-cc)). Spawning biomass in `r assess_yr` is estimated to be less than the LRP of $0.3SB_0$ with a `r f(cc_prob_less_03sbo[2] * 100, 1)`\% probability (Table \@ref(tab:ref-points-cc)).
