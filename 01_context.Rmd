# Context

Pacific Herring abundance is assessed using a statistical catch-age (SCA) model.
In 2017, the Pacific Herring stock assessment included updates to the model [Integrated Statistical catch-age model; @martell2011], and a bridging analysis to support these changes [@cleary2018]. Also introduced in the 2017 assessment was the estimation of stock productivity and current stock status relative to the new limit reference point (LRP) of $0.3\mli{SB}_0$ [@kronlund2017]. The structure of the 2017 model was not changed for the 2018 and 2019 stock assessments.

In 2016 DFO committed to renewing the current management framework to address a range of challenges facing Pacific Herring stocks and fisheries in BC. Renewal of the management framework includes conducting a Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) process to evaluate the performance of candidate management procedures against a range of hypotheses about uncertain stock and fishery dynamics. As part of the MSE process, a CSAS regional peer review occurred July 25 and 26, 2018, where performance of Pacific Herring management procedures were assessed against conservation objectives for Strait of Georgia and West Coast of Vancouver Island stock assessment regions [@dfo2018]. A similar analysis occurred on in 2019, to assess performance of MPs for Haida Gwaii, Prince Rupert District, and Central Coast [@dfo2019].

Estimated stock trajectories, current status of stocks for `r assess_yr`, and harvest advice recommendations for `r assess_yr + 1` reflect methods of @cleary2018 and, where applicable, recommendations from the aforementioned 2018 and 2019 MSE analyses. These recommendations are described in the section “Harvest recommendations for `r assess_yr + 1`”. <!-- \nameref{secProjHarv}''.--> 

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Pacific Fisheries Management Branch requested that DFO Pacific Science Branch assess the status of British Columbia (BC) Pacific Herring stocks in `r assess_yr` and recommend harvest advice for `r assess_yr + 1` to inform the development of the `r assess_yr`/`r assess_yr + 1` Integrated Fisheries Management Plan.
